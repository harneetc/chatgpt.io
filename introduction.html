  <h2>ðŸ§  Introduction of Technology: ChatGPT</h2>

  <h3>1. What technology did the team choose?</h3>
  <p>
    Our group chose <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, a generative AI language model developed by <strong>OpenAI</strong>.
    ChatGPT is built on the <em>Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)</em> architectureâ€”an advanced form of
    artificial intelligence trained on vast amounts of online text. By predicting the most likely next word in
    a sentence based on context, ChatGPT can generate human-like responses, write essays, translate languages,
    summarize content, produce code, and answer questions.
  </p>

  <h3>2. What is ChatGPT?</h3>
  <p>
    What makes ChatGPT unique is its ability to engage in <strong>meaningful, dynamic conversations</strong> with users.
    Using <em>natural language processing (NLP)</em> and <em>machine learning</em>, it simulates human communication across a
    wide range of fields, including education, healthcare, journalism, customer service, and software development.
    Its flexibility and ease of use make it a powerful tool across many sectors.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Why did the team choose ChatGPT?</h3>
  <p>
    We chose ChatGPT because of its <strong>rapidly growing influence</strong> in everyday life and the important
    <strong>ethical questions</strong> it raises. As this technology becomes more deeply integrated into schools, workplaces,
    and online platforms, it is reshaping how people access information, make decisions, and communicate. Whether itâ€™s
    assisting with schoolwork or supporting mental health inquiries, ChatGPT offers great promiseâ€”but it also demands
    thoughtful and responsible use. This balance of potential and risk makes it an essential subject for deeper analysis.
